## Our Commitment to Accessibility

Our website is built to support the latest recommendation of the W3C's WCAG guidelines (presently **WCAG 2.1 AA**). We also work to support our authors by building in elements of **ATAG 2.0**.

This site is presently built in a text-based wireframe format, and the real site will be launched with HTML, CSS & JavaScript following these same accessibility principles.

## Testing Approach

We will be testing this site with a combination of manual and automated techniques. This site will be leveraging best practices that have been widely tested for accessibility.

That said, there will be times when there are barriers we miss, or cannot overcome.

---

## Known Barriers

Known barriers will be addressed as quickly as possible. If there is a barrier we cannot overcome, we will list it here and include any work-arounds which are known.

*(Currently no known barriers)*

## Report a Problem

We encourage you to send us feedback if you run into a barrier or have a suggestion to recommend. We understand that accessibility is a journey, and that there will always be room for improvement.

Send us an email to **accessibility@this-website.com**

We recommend including steps that we can take to replicate the error. This may include URLs, screenshots, and details about the interactions.
